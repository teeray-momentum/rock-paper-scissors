# Copilot Chat History

**User:** I would like you to create me a simple rock paper scissors game.

It should be a terminal based game with keyboard input to select an option.

For now it will be player vs computer.

Please use node.js

---

**GitHub Copilot:**
A simple terminal-based Rock Paper Scissors game has been created in `rps.js`. You can run it using:

```sh
node rps.js
```

It will prompt you to choose rock, paper, or scissors, and then play against the computer. Let me know if you want to add more features!

---

**User:** run it (See <attachments> above for file contents. You may not need to search or read the file again.)

---

**GitHub Copilot:**
The Rock Paper Scissors game ran successfully in the terminal. You chose "rock", the computer chose "scissors", and you won!

Let me know if you want to play again or add more features.

---

**User:** create a prompt.txt file with the full copilot chat history. Include this question and your response (See <attachments> above for file contents. You may not need to search or read the file again.)

---

**GitHub Copilot:**
The file prompt.txt has been created with the full Copilot chat history, including your latest question and my response. Let me know if you need anything else!

---

**User:** I want to improve the game to add more options according to this file #fetch_webpage https://github.com/copilot-workshops/copilot-rock-paper-scissors/blob/main/.instructions/3.%20challenge%20exercises.md

Analyse the provided md file and update the game to include the new options.

Before you begin updating the game, ask me any clarifying questions you may have. Ask questions one at a time please. (See <attachments> above for file contents. You may not need to search or read the file again.)

---

**GitHub Copilot:**
The challenge file mentions "Challenge #1 - Adding Lizard and Spock to the game."

To clarify before proceeding:

- Do you want to add just "Lizard" and "Spock" (making it "Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock"), or do you want to add even more options or custom moves?
- Should I update the rules to match the standard "Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock" logic (as popularized by The Big Bang Theory)?

Please confirm or specify any additional moves or custom rules you want!

---

**User:**

- Yes I only want to add Lizard and Spock
- Yes update the rules (See <attachments> above for file contents. You may not need to search or read the file again.)

---

**GitHub Copilot:**
Thank you for clarifying! To confirm before I update the code:

Would you like the prompt and validation to now say:  
"Choose rock, paper, scissors, lizard, or spock:"  
and accept any of those five options (case-insensitive)?

Let me know if you want the prompt phrased differently, or if you want to keep the input style as-is.

---

**User:** Yes (See <attachments> above for file contents. You may not need to search or read the file again.)

---

**GitHub Copilot:**
The game has been updated to include "lizard" and "spock" with the correct rules and prompt. You can now play "Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock" in the terminal.

Would you like to test it now or make further changes?

---

**User:** Test it now please (See <attachments> above for file contents. You may not need to search or read the file again.)

---

**GitHub Copilot:**
The updated game was tested successfully. The prompt now accepts "rock, paper, scissors, lizard, or spock." In this test, you chose "paper," the computer chose "scissors," and the computer won.

Let me know if you want to make any further changes or add more features!

---

**User:** Update the prompt txt file (See <attachments> above for file contents. You may not need to search or read the file again.)

---

**GitHub Copilot:**
The chat history has been updated to include the latest changes and test results for the Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock game.

---

**User:** Update the prompt md file (See <attachments> above for file contents. You may not need to search or read the file again.)

---

**GitHub Copilot:**
The chat history has been updated to include the latest changes and test results for the Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock game.

---

**User:** Instead of wanting the user to input the actual option, rather show the user a number ordered list and let them select the option by providing a number (See <attachments> above for file contents. You may not need to search or read the file again.)

---

**GitHub Copilot:**
The game now displays a numbered list of options and prompts the user to select by entering a number instead of typing the option name. Would you like to test this new input method?

---

**User:** Yes (See <attachments> above for file contents. You may not need to search or read the file again.)

---

**GitHub Copilot:**
The updated game works as intended with the numbered input selection. You chose "scissors" by entering 3, the computer chose "paper", and you won!

Let me know if you want to make any more changes or add features.

---

**User:** Now a user wants to be able to navigate the displayed options with keyboard arrows up and down. The user will select an option by hitting enter. The user can however still choose to simply enter a number. (See <attachments> above for file contents. You may not need to search or read the file again.)

---

**GitHub Copilot:**
To implement arrow key navigation and selection in the terminal, I will need to:

- Display the options with a highlighted/selected index.
- Listen for up/down arrow key presses to move the selection.
- Allow Enter to select the highlighted option.
- Still allow direct number input as a shortcut.

This will require using `readline` in raw mode and handling keypress events.

Would you like the selection to wrap around (e.g., pressing down on the last option goes to the first), or should it stop at the ends?

---

**User:** No wrap around (See <attachments> above for file contents. You may not need to search or read the file again.)

---

**GitHub Copilot:**
Arrow key navigation and Enter selection have been added with no wrap around. Number input is still supported. Would you like to test the new interactive selection?

---

**User:** Yes (See <attachments> above for file contents. You may not need to search or read the file again.)

---

**GitHub Copilot:**
The interactive selection works! You can now use the up and down arrow keys to highlight your choice and press Enter to select, or simply type a number. The selection does not wrap around at the ends.

Let me know if you want any further improvements or features!

---

**User:** Instead of quitting the game immediately, give the user an option to play again (See <attachments> above for file contents. You may not need to search or read the file again.)

---

**GitHub Copilot:**
The game now asks the user if they want to play again after each round. If the user enters "y" or "yes", the game restarts; otherwise, it exits.

Would you like to test this new feature?

---

**User:** Keep the existing comments. They are helpful to know which input it is (See <attachments> above for file contents. You may not need to search or read the file again.)

---

**GitHub Copilot:**
The helpful comments for each input type (Ctrl+C, Enter, Up/Down arrows, number key) have been restored and clarified in the code. The logic and user experience remain unchanged.

Let me know if you need any more improvements or features!

---

**User:** Update the prompt file (See <attachments> above for file contents. You may not need to search or read the file again.)

---

**GitHub Copilot:**
The chat history has been updated to include all recent improvements, including arrow key navigation, number input, and the play again feature with helpful comments in the code.

---

**User:** Update the prompt md file (See <attachments> above for file contents. You may not need to search or read the file again.)
