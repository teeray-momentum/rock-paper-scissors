# Copilot Chat History

**User:** I would like you to create me a simple rock paper scissors game.

It should be a terminal based game with keyboard input to select an option.

For now it will be player vs computer.

Please use node.js

**GitHub Copilot:**
A simple terminal-based Rock Paper Scissors game has been created in `rps.js`. You can run it using:

```sh
node rps.js
```

It will prompt you to choose rock, paper, or scissors, and then play against the computer. Let me know if you want to add more features!

**User:** run it (See <attachments> above for file contents. You may not need to search or read the file again.)

The Rock Paper Scissors game ran successfully in the terminal. You chose "rock", the computer chose "scissors", and you won!
